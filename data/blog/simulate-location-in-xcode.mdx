When working on an app that requires it to point it to a specific location or simulate a custom location movement, it's tedious to set it up manually in a simulator or on iOS devices every time. We have a few ways to sort them quickly once so that you and your team can point to multiple locations after that.

## Static Location Simulation

When we want to point to a custom static location, we have two options:

 - Default static location
 - Custom static location

### Default static location

Xcode comes with a few default cities to help simulate locations. It can be done in three ways:

#### By editing schemes

Navigate to the Edit scheme by taping on the Product Menu and in the Run menu under the Options tab, as shown in the below screenshot:

![Options in Edit Scheme Under Run](/images/articles/iOS/swift/004-simulate-location-in-xcode/edit-scheme-options.webp)

![Core Location inside Options in Edit Scheme Under Run](/images/articles/iOS/swift/004-simulate-location-in-xcode/edit-schemes-option-core-location.webp)

Make sure the Allow location simulation is selected, and you can select a location from the given option to simulate the simulator/device to point to that location when the app is launched.

#### From the menu bar

Tap Debug from the Xcode menu bar and click simulate location. The same default locations options will be visible, as seen in the below screenshot:

![Stimulate Location under Debug option in Xcode's Menu Bar](/images/articles/iOS/swift/004-simulate-location-in-xcode/debug-simulate-location.webp)

#### From the bottom debug bar

![Stimulate Location under Debug option in Xcode's bottom Bar](/images/articles/iOS/swift/004-simulate-location-in-xcode/bottom-debug-bar-custom-location.webp)

<p class="important">Note</p>

This option will be enabled when the app is enabled with location permission


### Custom static location

If we need to point our app to a particular location, for example, to point to my hometown, [Tiruchirappalli](https://goo.gl/maps/TqinzARhuNBWhjGH6) (which is not available as part of the default list), we need the coordinates.

<p class="tip">Tip</p>

Coordinates of any location can be easily taken by right-clicking on Google maps


![Google's Maps showing Tiruchirappalli location](/images/articles/iOS/swift/004-simulate-location-in-xcode/google-maps-tiruchirappalli-pin.webp)

Once we get them, Go to the Simulator menu, tap Features → Custom Location, and enter the coordinates. The app will not start pointing to the custom location now.

#### Custom static location using GPX file

To simulate a location, we can use a GPX file.

> GPX, or GPS Exchange Format, is an [XML schema](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_schema) designed as a common [GPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS) data format for software applications. It can be used to describe [waypoints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waypoint), [tracks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS_tracking), and routes.

```xml

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<gpx xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xmlns="http://www.topografix.com/GPX/1/1" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.topografix.com/GPX/1/1 http://www.topografix.com/GPX/1/1/gpx.xsd" version="1.1" creator="Open GPX Tracker for iOS">
	<wpt lat="10.770822704808955" lon="78.88960536898259">
		<time>2022-12-04T19:13:26Z</time>
		<name>7:13:26 PM</name>
		<desc>04-Dec-2022 at 7:13:26 PM</desc>
	</wpt>
	<trk>
	</trk>
</gpx>

```

#### How to create a GPX file?

Xcode File Menu → New → File (Ctrl+N), Navigate to Resource column, you can able to find the GPX File option, click Next, define a name, and you are done

![Example of GPX File showing location of Apple Campus](/images/articles/iOS/swift/004-simulate-location-in-xcode/example-gpx-file.webp)
<p class="imageCredits">The default GPX file is the location of Apple Campus.</p>

<p class="tip">Tip</p>

You can create a GPX file with only one waypoint (`<wpt>`) with a coordinate you want to simulate


Once its done, select it under the edit scheme location selection as shown below:

![Selection of GPX file under Core Location inside Options in Edit Scheme Under Run](/images/articles/iOS/swift/004-simulate-location-in-xcode/edit-scheme-location-selection.webp)

<p class="tip">Tip</p>

Here by default, Xcode created a waypoint with name and time, but those are not the mandatory properties.

We can save any number of location points(coordinates) as GPX files and use them in Xcode.


#### Dynamic (Multiple) Location Simulation

If our app needs to simulate a location movement like needed in a fitness app or location tracking feature in the app, then just a single custom coordinate is not enough. In those cases, we can need to use multiple `<wpt>` tags in a GPX file!

```xml

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<gpx xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xmlns="http://www.topografix.com/GPX/1/1" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.topografix.com/GPX/1/1 http://www.topografix.com/GPX/1/1/gpx.xsd" version="1.1" creator="Open GPX Tracker for iOS">
	<wpt lat="10.79800206061308" lon="78.6870669099">
		<time>2022-12-04T17:28:09Z</time>
		<name>5:28:09 PM</name>
		<desc>04-Dec-2022 at 5:28:09 PM</desc>
	</wpt>
	<wpt lat="10.813891267686442" lon="78.68684628670012">
		<time>2022-12-04T17:28:15Z</time>
		<name>5:28:15 PM</name>
		<desc>04-Dec-2022 at 5:30:15 PM</desc>
	</wpt>
	<wpt lat="10.85973245384515" lon="78.6952043334087">
		<time>2022-12-04T17:28:27Z</time>
		<name>5:28:27 PM</name>
		<desc>04-Dec-2022 at 5:32:27 PM</desc>
	</wpt>
	<wpt lat="10.910765553385477" lon="78.69941560728294">
		<time>2022-12-04T17:28:32Z</time>
		<name>5:28:32 PM</name>
		<desc>04-Dec-2022 at 5:34:32 PM</desc>
	</wpt>
	<trk>
	</trk>
</gpx>

```

Time (`<time>`) tag is needed here to simulate realistic movement, and Xcode will interpolate movement at a rate of speed based on the time elapsed between each waypoint. If you do not provide a time element, Xcode will use a fixed rate of speed.


The time taken from one point to the next is determined by the difference between the `<time>` elements

Time taken to travel from P0 to P1 = (P1 Time) - (P0 Time)

In the example above, the time for Point 1 is `2022–12–04T17:28:09Z` and for Point 2 is `2022–12–04T17:30:15Z`. It is a difference of two seconds. Xcode will use two seconds to go from Point 1 to Point 2. During this duration, the location will change, which means that if you implemented

```swift

func locationManager(
    _ manager: CLLocationManager,   
    didUpdateLocations locations: [CLLocation]
)

```

you will receive the updates between the two seconds of Xcode simulating from Point 1 to Point 2.

<p class="important">Important</p>

Waypoints must be sorted by time in ascending order


#### GPX tracker

There are many tools available to generate a GPX file with our dedicated inputs, one of them is [GPXTracker](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/open-gpx-tracker/id984503772) an [opensource](https://github.com/merlos/iOS-Open-GPX-Tracker) tool that I use:

Install the app and open it. Simply long-tap on the location points where you want, as shown below:

![Create new gxp file using gpx tracker app](/images/articles/iOS/swift/004-simulate-location-in-xcode/create-new-gpx-file-using-gpx-tracker.gif)

Once you place the points, you can tap on save from the bottom bar with desired name and drag and drop the saved one to Xcode.

![New gpx filed added into xcode](/images/articles/iOS/swift/004-simulate-location-in-xcode/add-genrated-gpx-file-in-xcode-and-select-in-custom-location-option.gif)

Xcode also comes with a few default dynamic location simulations (predefined moments), which you can use if they fit your app use case to debug:

1. City Run
2. City Bicycle Ride
3. Freeway Drive

These three options will simulate a movement for running, riding, and driving, varying by speed. This is great for quick debugging.

![Default dynamic location simulations in simulator](/images/articles/iOS/swift/004-simulate-location-in-xcode/default-dynamic-location-simulations.webp)

This is suitable for a quick test since you don’t have control over the movement route. To have better control, you have to simulate movement in Xcode with a GPX file.

### Cons of location simulation

These simulations are generally for testing/implementation purposes since they do not help in the actual movement speed and accuracy.
