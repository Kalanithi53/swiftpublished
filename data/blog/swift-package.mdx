## <p class="important">Disclaimer</p>

This article doesn’t explain what is a Swift Package Plugin, but just provides Source Code of the demos discussed in the related WWDC videos.

I hope you will have better resources to start diving into Swift Package Plugin, next time we will understand in detail what it is, how it works & where we can use it.

## [Meet Swift Package plugins](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/110359/)

In this WWDC video, [@Anders Bertelrud](https://github.com/abertelrud) walks us through the basics of Plugins. But, it doesn’t show the code as he used the remote Package dependencies.

I tried to search for the packages used, had some luck to find related code examples from [@Anders Bertelrud](https://github.com/abertelrud)’s repos. Forked them to keep a record in case upstream is deleted.

## <p class="important">Note</p>

These repos are not updated & might not work. But, they might be a good starting point to learn about Plugin & what it can do.

## [Create Swift Package plugins](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/110401)

In this WWDC video, [@Boris Bugling](https://twitter.com/NeoNacho) actually creates the Plugins, you can find the snippets in the video link, but the complete code is not downloadable. So, I have created working swift packages for you.
