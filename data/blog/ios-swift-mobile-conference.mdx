Swift community is fantastic and spread all around the world. Conferences are the best option for better learning and meeting new friends. Wherever you live there might be a conference happening nearby. Some people like me who are interested in travelling can attend a conference anywhere so they can explore that place too.

## <p class="note">🏆 Learning + New Friends + Holiday = Triple Win</p>


Now the whole world is getting back to normal from the covid19 pandemic, a few community volunteers, and conference organisers have announced the dates for 2024 and 2025. They are sorted in upcoming order.
