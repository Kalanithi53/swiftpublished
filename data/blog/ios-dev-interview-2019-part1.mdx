Interview - a common word we hear most in the corporate world.


1510s, "face-to-face meeting, formal conference" from Middle French _entrevue_, verbal noun from _s'entrevoir_, "to see each other, visit each other briefly, have a glimpse of" from _entre-_ "between"

From a fresher to CEO, everyone needs to appear for an interview at some time. After a few interesting experiences and some research, I found some easy ways to prepare for iOS Developer Interview and crack it with confidence.

## General Questions
1. Tell me about your last/current project ?
2. Explain the architecture of your current project ?
3. Tell me about your role in the project ?
4. What are the challenges you faced in the project ?

These four are the most important questions we need to be careful, so answer them clear and confident.

<p class="note">Note</p>

The First Impression is the best impression. Whether in telephonic round or one on one technical round. Our first 15 minutes has an important role always.

When youâ€™re appearing for a startup or a small scale organisation end to end knowledge is must. Where as in the big companies they have a dedicated team for Release and Deployment of apps in the AppsStore.

1. What are the different type of certificates available ?
2. How many internal and external testers are allowed in iTunesConnect ?
