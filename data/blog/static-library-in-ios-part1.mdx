## What is a Static Library
Itâ€™s nothing fancy, but aÂ *collection*Â ofÂ *compiled*Â *source code files*Â to achieve aÂ *particular functionality*.

Letâ€™s say we haveÂ **FileA.swift**,Â **FileB.swift**Â &Â **FileC.swift**, then we can compile them & wrap them together to form a Static Library which will have an extension ofÂ **[.a](https://stackoverflow.com/a/9810368/11787787)**Â (short for Archive).

Simply put, itâ€™s like:

  style={{ backgroundColor: 'rgba(230, 230, 230, 1.0)' }}
/>
<p className="imageCredits">Static Library Packaging</p>


## Why to use it

- **Code Reusability**: Suppose we have a common piece of functionality across multiple Apps, we can create a static library out of those common source codes & share across all our Apps instead of duplicating them.
- **Code Abstraction**: We can hide the code which shouldnâ€™t be known to the client App by marking Headers as Private or Internal.
- **Code Encapsulation**: By distributing just the Static Library Binary (*will discuss on later part of this Article*), we can just share the functionalities & hide the implementation details from the clients.
- **Ease of Use**: Clients shouldnâ€™t worry about the nitty-gritty of the functionalities, They should get just the bare-minimum with the least effort.
- **Maintainability**: When we have a central place for all our code, we can easily fix a bug & share it with the clients with just a version bump.
- **Reduce App Compile Time**: By distributing just the Pre-Compiled Static Library Binary, we can reduce the compile time of the App compared to compiling all those source files needed for the piece of functionality.
- **Reduce App Launch Time**: The way Static Libraries work (*will discuss on later parts of this Article*) compared to Dynamic Frameworks, we can minimise onÂ ***[dylib loading time](https://useyourloaf.com/blog/slow-app-startup-times/)***Â ofÂ ***[Pre-main time](https://useyourloaf.com/blog/slow-app-startup-times/)***Â which helps in faster App Lauch.

## How to create one

We are going to create aÂ Static Library calledÂ **Painter**Â which can paint a random color on a View passed by the Client App.

### Responsibilities of Painter

- Logic to generate a random color
- Logic to paint it on a View passed by the Client App

#### Step 1

![Generate random Color in Code](/images/articles/iOS/framework/static/step-4-2.png)

#### Step 5
Letâ€™s Build for Simulator, we would see something like this on DerivedData Folder of Xcode.

![DerivedData Build for Simulator](/images/articles/iOS/framework/static/step-5.png)

#### Step 6
Letâ€™s Build for Generic iOS Device, we would see something like this on DerivedData Folder of Xcode.

## What are the contents of a Static Library

As discussed earlier, Static Library is nothing but:

  style={{ backgroundColor: 'rgba(230, 230, 230, 1.0)' }}
/>
<p className="imageCredits">Static Library Packaging Flow</p>


We can useÂ **[ar](https://linux.die.net/man/1/ar)**Â tool to see theÂ [Object Files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_file)Â inside theÂ *libPainter.a*:

![Contents of a Static Library](/images/articles/iOS/framework/static/contents.png)
<p class="imageCredits">Contents of a Static Library</p>

We can useÂ **[nm](https://linux.die.net/man/1/nm)**Â tool to see theÂ *Symbols*Â (eg: Types & Functions) declared inside theÂ *libPainter.a*, notice the first one inÂ *Painter.O*Â is for our only public functionÂ `paintRandomColor(onView view: UIView)`

![Symbols contained in a Static Library](/images/articles/iOS/framework/static/symbols.png)

## How to use it in a Client App

#### Step 7
(in continuation to previous steps)
![Project Menu](/images/articles/iOS/framework/static/step-7.png)

#### Step 8
![App Template](/images/articles/iOS/framework/static/step-8.png)

#### Step 9
![Create Project](/images/articles/iOS/framework/static/step-9.png)

#### Step 10
Letâ€™s create a folder namedÂ *StaticLibrary*Â somewhere safe(say Desktop) & copy theÂ `.swiftdoc`Â &Â `.swiftmodule` files from both the *Debug-iphonesimulator* & *Debug-iphoneos* folders of Painter Static Library.

This folder will be needed to integrate the Static Library in the Client App.

![Swift Module](/images/articles/iOS/framework/static/step-10-1.png)

It should look something like this now:

![Swift Module folder](/images/articles/iOS/framework/static/step-10-1.png)

`.swiftdoc`Â &Â `.swiftmodule` files basically mimic the Objective-C Header for a Swift Module.

#### Step 11
Letâ€™s create a Universal Binary or a Fat Binary which can work for both the iOS Simulator & iOS Device usingÂ **[lipo](https://ss64.com/osx/lipo.html)**Â tool using command:

```bash

lipo -create path_to_archive_for_simulator path_to_archive_for_device -output path_for_universal_binary

```

![Create Universal Binary using lipo in Terminal](/images/articles/iOS/framework/static/step-11-1.png)

<p class="important">Important</p>

**Universal Binary**Â =Â ***libPainter.a***Â fromÂ *Debug-iphonesimulator*Â +Â ***libPainter.a*** fromÂ *Debug-iphoneos*


Now ourÂ *StaticLibrary*Â folder should look something like this:

![Copy Swiftmodule](/images/articles/iOS/framework/static/step-11-2.png)

This folder is all thatâ€™s needed to integrate the Static Library in the Client App. Now we can distribute this folder to our Clients.

#### Step 12
Letâ€™s Copy & Paste theÂ *StaticLibrary*Â Folder from the previous step into the PainterClientApp root directory.

![Copy StaticLibrary](/images/articles/iOS/framework/static/step-12.png)

#### Step 13
Letâ€™s AddÂ *libPainter.a*Â to Link Binary with Libraries of App Target Build Settings.

    </iframe>

<p class="imageCredits">How to link Static library to the App</p>

#### Step 14
Letâ€™s SetÂ ***$(SRCROOT)/StaticLibrary***Â as `LIBRARY SEARCH PATHS` & `IMPORT PATHS` of App Target Build Settings

**LIBRARY SEARCH PATHS**

A list of Folders(or Paths) which Xcode(ratherÂ [Linker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linker_(computing))) will search for Library(.a) Files. You may already know about FRAMEWORK SEARCH PATHS, itâ€™s similar to that, but for Libraries.

**IMPORT PATHS**

A list of Folders(or Paths) which Xcode(ratherÂ [Compiler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler)) will search for additional Swift Modules. You may already know HEADER SEARCH PATHS, Itâ€™s similar to that, but for Swift Libraries.

#### Step 15
Letâ€™sÂ `import Painter`Â & use theÂ `paintRandomColor`Â method from the Static Library in ViewController.

![Using StaticLibrary](/images/articles/iOS/framework/static/step-15.png)

#### Step 16
Letâ€™s Build & Run the App in both the Simulator & Device. We can see different random colors on every launch.

    </iframe>


<p class="imageCredits">Demo of App using Static Library</p>

#### Step 17
Letâ€™s check if Archive also works, if we would see the contents in the Archive byÂ *Show Package Contents*, thenÂ *Products*Â ->Â *Applications*Â ->Â *Show Package Contents for*Â **PainterClientApp**, then we would find no sign of ourÂ **Painter**Â Static Library. Thatâ€™s because itâ€™s sitting right inside the App Binary. We will understand this in more detail in the next section.

## How it works

Letâ€™s check forÂ *Show Package Contents for*Â ourÂ **PainterClientApp**Â first.

![Contents of App Package](/images/articles/iOS/framework/static/app-package.png)
<p class="imageCredits">Contents of App Package</p>

Even if we just linkedÂ *libPainter.a*Â to our App Target, it got copied into App Binary. Thatâ€™s because of Static Linking of the Library.

<img
  alt="Static Library Linking"
  src="/images/articles/iOS/framework/static/static-library-linking.png"
  style={{ backgroundColor: 'rgba(230, 230, 230, 1.0)' }}
/>
<p className="imageCredits">Static Library Linking</p>


So, now when System loads our App, it loads the Static Library Functionality as a single App Executable. Hence, the faster load/launch time.

## When not to use it

Static Libraries are great for code reusability and abstracting things. But, it has few demerits compared to itâ€™s counterparts: Dynamic Libraries & Dynamic Frameworks.

- **Higher App Size**: As Static Library Object Files are directly copied to the App Binary, app size is bloated. Dynamic Libraries are loosely linked to the App, whereas Static Libraries are hard linked to the app.Â For instance System Frameworks like UIKit are loaded when needed, App just keeps a reference to it, hence doesnâ€™t add to the App Size which Users are going to download on their precious Network.
- **Resources**: As Static Libraries are just a collection of Source Code, it canâ€™t have Resources like Assets, Xibs, Storyboards & JSONs which are essential for many functionalities.Â Distributing Static Library along with a Resource Bundle solves this problem to a great extent, but Dynamic Frameworks really shine here.

## Conclusion

In this post weÂ have learned how to leverage the use of Static Libraries to bundle up common functionalities across multiple Apps, how it will reduce duplicity & help maintainability. We have also put some light on the areas where Static Libraries donâ€™t shine compared to Dynamic Libraries & Frameworks.

Try to figure out the scenarios where you can make good use of them for a Cleaner, Sharable & Maintainable Approach.
