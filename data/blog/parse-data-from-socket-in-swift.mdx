<p class="intro">When I was working in a trading app, there is a need to rely on a socket connection to get realtime data. So every time I get data from the socket, need to parse it and feed it into the view to display the data.</p>

Language like JAVA comes with powerful  [ByteBuffer](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/ByteBuffer.html) to make life easier in this case. In iOS, we do not have an exact alternative but we do have options:

#### 1. Strings in Swift comes with handy default initializers to parse data

Example:

```swift

let unit8: [UInt8] = [67, 97, 102, 195, 169]  
let strFromUInt8 = String(decoding: unit8, as: UTF8.self)

print(strFromUInt8) // "Cafe\n"

let data: Data = Data(unit8)  
let stringFromData = String(data: data, encoding: .utf8)

print(stringFromData) // "Optional("Cafe")\n"

```

<p class="important">Important</p>

-  Itâ€™s never safe to force-unwrap a data-to-string transformation.
-  Strings in Swift use Unicode internally, so encoding a string using a Unicode encoding will always succeed.


So parsing strings from the socket is straight forward. But the same is possible for other types like Int, Double, etc.

#### 2. Using Pointers

How to get the data into a proper Swift type like an `Int` or `Float`? Swiftâ€™s type system is strict enough that you canâ€™t force a typecast to an unrelated type. We canâ€™t cast the bytes contained in a  `Data`  object to an  `Int`.

There is no `Int` constructor that takes a `Data` or raw bytes (Strings in swift are lucky as seen in option 1 above ðŸ˜œ). The method `withUnsafeBytes(_:)` is the [method](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/array/2635991-withunsafebytes) we need for all our data conversion needs.


Calls the given closure with a pointer to the underlying bytes of the arrayâ€™s contiguous storage.


**Int:**

```swift

let unit8: [UInt8] = [136, 3]
let integer = unit8.withUnsafeBytes {$0.load(as: UInt16.self)}
print(integer) // "904\n"

```

**Double:**

```swift

let unit8: [UInt8] = [154, 153, 153, 153, 153, 130, 151, 64]
let double = unit8.withUnsafeBytes {$0.load(as: Double.self)}
print(double) // "1504.65\n"

```

This method `withUnsafeBytes` gets closure, and it passes a pointer into that closure. The type of the pointer is generic `UnsafePointer<T>`, and you define what the type of data the pointer contains. If you know you were sent a 32-bit integer, set your closure parameter as `UnsafePointer<Int32>`.

So, when a data object is received like below:

```swift

let data: [UInt8] = [0,0,48,50,54,45,49,50,45,50,48,49,57,32,49,  
                     57,58,48,53,58, 52,56,0,50,54,45,49,50,45,  
                     50,48,49,57,32,49,57,58,48,53,58,52,57,0,50,  
                     54,45,49,50,45,50,48,49,57,32,49,57,58,48,53,  
                     58,52,57,0,78,82,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,  
                     0,0,0,0,0,]
                     
```

this data may contain multiple elements(types) into it, to traverse into this array of UInt8 and get the type we need, we can add an extension to  `Array`

```swift

public extension Array {
    func slice(_ from: Int, count: Int) ->  ArraySlice<Element>? {
        guard (0 <= from && from < self.count) && (from < from+count && from+count < self.count) else {
            return nil
        }
        return self[from...from+count-1]
    }
}

```

then we can extend the ArraySlice to parse the chunked array of elements from the parent array to our desired type

```swift

public extension ArraySlice {
    private func array() -> [Element] {
        return Array(self)
    }

    func withAlignedBytes<R>(_ body: (UnsafeRawBufferPointer) throws -> R) rethrows -> R {
        if startIndex == 0 || startIndex % MemoryLayout<R>.alignment == 0 {
            return try self.withUnsafeBytes(body)
        } else {
            return try self.array().withUnsafeBytes(body)
        }
    }
}

```

now we can conclude with extending array with our desired type functions like below:

```swift

public extension Array where Array.Element == UInt8 {
    func getString(atIndex: Int, count: Int) -> String? {
        guard let bytes = self.slice(atIndex, count: count) else { return nil }
        guard let string = String(bytes: bytes, encoding: .utf8)?.trim() else { return nil }
        return string
    }

    func getInt(atIndex: Int, count: Int) -> Int? {
        guard let bytes = self.slice(atIndex, count: count) else { return nil }
        let int = bytes.withAlignedBytes {$0.load(as: UInt16.self)}
        return Int(int)
    }

    func getDouble(atIndex: Int, count: Int) -> Double? {
        guard let bytes = self.slice(atIndex, count: count) else { return nil }
        let double = bytes.withAlignedBytes {$0.load(as: Double.self)}
        return double
    }

    func getDecimal(atIndex: Int, count: Int) -> Decimal? {
        guard let bytes = self.slice(atIndex, count: count) else { return nil }
        let decimal = bytes.withAlignedBytes {$0.load(as: Decimal.self)}
        return decimal
    }
}

```

now we can use the above code by:

```swift

let myString = data.getString(atIndex: 0, count: 6) 
print(myString) // "MuraliK"

```

Ok, these look cool when we know the count of sub-array, if a situation comes when we don know the count, then we have to calculate the length by ourselves.

![array-length](/images/articles/iOS/swift/013-parse-data-from-socket-in-swift/array-length.webp)

```swift

extension Array where Element == UInt8 {
    func stringEndIndex(from startIndex: Int = 0) -> Int? {
        findStringEndIndex(from: startIndex)
    }

    // Method to calculate the end index of string
    private func findStringEndIndex(from startIndex: Int, to endIndex: Int? = nil) -> Int? {
        guard (endIndex == .none) || (endIndex != nil && endIndex! <= startIndex && endIndex! < count) 
        
        else { return nil } // Not a valid string
        guard startIndex < count else { return endIndex }

        var arraySlice = self[0...startIndex]
        guard !arraySlice.contains(where: { 0...31 ~= $0 }) else { return endIndex }
        
        if String(data: Data(arraySlice), encoding: .utf8) != nil {
            return findStringEndIndex(from: startIndex + 1, to: startIndex)
        }

        guard startIndex + 1 < count else { return endIndex }
        arraySlice = self[0 ... startIndex + 1]
        
        guard !arraySlice.contains(where: { 0...31 ~= $0 }) else { return endIndex }
        
        if String(data: Data(arraySlice), encoding: .utf8) != nil {
            return findStringEndIndex(from: startIndex + 2, to: startIndex + 1)
        }

        guard startIndex + 3 < count else { return endIndex }
        arraySlice = self[0 ... startIndex + 3]
        
        guard !arraySlice.contains(where: { 0...31 ~= $0 }) else { return endIndex }
        
        if String(data: Data(arraySlice), encoding: .utf8) != nil {
            return findStringEndIndex(from: startIndex + 4, to: startIndex + 3)
        }

        return endIndex
    }
}

```

#### Using Decoder

It is basically Swiftâ€™s internal `Decodable` + Creating custom containers for parsing `[UInt8]` to the respective Types specified in concrete Type of Decodable leveraging the power of Protocols.

**BinaryDecodable**  protocol confirming to Swiftâ€™s  `Decodable`  protocol

**BinaryDecoder**  class confirming to Swiftâ€™s  `Decoder`  protocol

It mocks the `Container` behaviour, It specifies the way to decode any Type when called by Decoder internally for all the properties with an associated Type in the Struct.

### Conclusion
We tried to use all three ways to parse the socket data to understand which is more flexible and error-free. We found the method 2 using `withUnsafeBytes(_:)` is easy to read, maintain and available for all types.
