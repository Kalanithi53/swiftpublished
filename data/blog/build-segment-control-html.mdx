Segmented Control is quite popular in Mobile, this is how it looks in [iOS](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/segmented-controls) & [Android](https://m3.material.io/components/segmented-buttons/overview). Considering itâ€™s popularity, there is a wide adoption in web as well.

Today we will be building a segmented control to toggle colour schemes on our website, rather recreate the one found on the footer of [Apple Developer website](https://developer.apple.com).

## Choosing the right UI element

I am writing this article as I am building it, so hopefully it will be simple to understand & will cover most of the grounds.

From what we already know, the right UI for this component would be a `radio input` as we can select only one segment at a time. So, letâ€™s try to add 3 radio inputs to an `index.html`

```html

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<body>
  <input id="light-color-scheme-radio" type="radio">
  <label for="light-color-scheme-radio">Light</label>

  <input id="dark-color-scheme-radio" type="radio">
  <label for="dark-color-scheme-radio">Dark</label>

  <input id="auto-color-scheme-radio" type="radio">
  <label for="auto-color-scheme-radio">Auto</label>
</body>

</html>

```
<p class="imageCredits">index.html</p>

## Styling Decisions

Looks like the horizontal alignment is fine, we need to change few things:

- hide the `radio` circle
- change background & foreground colour of selected `input`

### Hide the `radio` circle

Letâ€™s add an `index.css`, we would need to wrap the `radio` buttons on a `div`, then change the `display` property of `div.input`


```html

<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="index.css">
</head>

<body>
  <div class="color-scheme-segment-control">
    <input id="light-color-scheme-segment" type="radio">
    <label for="light-color-scheme-segment">Light</label>

    <input id="dark-color-scheme-segment" type="radio">
    <label for="dark-color-scheme-segment">Dark</label>

    <input id="auto-color-scheme-segment" type="radio">
    <label for="auto-color-scheme-segment">Auto</label>
  </div>
</body>

```
<p class="imageCredits">index.html</p>

```css

.color-scheme-segment-control input {
  display: none;
}

```
<p class="imageCredits">index.css</p>

### Change background & foreground colour of selected `input`

This is tricky, whenever a `radio input` is selected, we need to somehow change the style of its corresponding `label`

From w3schools [CSSÂ SelectorÂ Reference](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.php), looks like `[element + element]` (as referenced [here](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/sel_element_pluss.php)) might do the job, letâ€™s try by setting first `input` as `checked`


```html

<div class="color-scheme-segment-control">
    <input id="light-color-scheme-segment" type="radio" checked>
		<label for="light-color-scheme-segment">Light</label>
		...
</div>

```
<p class="imageCredits">index.html</p>

```css

#light-color-scheme-segment:checked + label {
  background-color: blue;
}

```
<p class="imageCredits">index.css</p>

### Output

![Output 3](/images/articles/web/build-a-segmented-control-in-html-css/output3.jpg)

okay, it works, but that means we have to duplicate the same style for other `input`s as well. Is there a way to combine the style for all the `input`s? May be if we gave them all the same `name` & somehow apply style to that `name` instead ðŸ¤”

From w3schools [CSSÂ SelectorÂ Reference](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.php), looks like `[*attribute*~=*value*]` (as referenced [here](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/sel_attribute_value_contains.php)) might do the job, letâ€™s try (we need to check if it works upon selection & deselection also)


```html

<div class="color-scheme-segment-control">
    <input id="light-color-scheme-segment" name="color-scheme-segment-input" type="radio" checked>
    <label for="light-color-scheme-segment">Light</label>

    <input id="dark-color-scheme-segment" name="color-scheme-segment-input" type="radio">
    <label for="dark-color-scheme-segment">Dark</label>

    <input id="auto-color-scheme-segment" name="color-scheme-segment-input" type="radio">
    <label for="auto-color-scheme-segment">Auto</label>
</div>

```
<p class="imageCredits">index.html</p>

```css

[name~="color-scheme-segment-input"]:checked + label {
  background-color: blue;
}

```
<p class="imageCredits">index.css</p>

### Output

<video 
  src="/images/articles/web/build-a-segmented-control-in-html-css/output4-segment-control.mov" 
  style={{width: '100%'}}  
  controls 
  loop 
  autoplay 
  muted 
  playsinline
></video>

Awesome ðŸ¥³ it works, even on selection & deselection

From here on, it should be easy for us to add other styles like foreground colour on selection.

## Final Styling

1. Outer `div` should place the `input`s & `label`s in centre

```css

.color-scheme-segment-control {
  display: inline-flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-content: center;
}

```
<p class="imageCredits">index.css</p>

2. Outer `div` should have some `padding`, `border` & capsule-button like look (we can achieve it by giving a really big corner radius)

```css

.color-scheme-segment-control {
  padding: 1px;
  border: solid 1px #306FDB;
  /* To make it look like a capsule */
  border-radius: 1000px;
}

```
<p class="imageCredits">index.css</p>

3. `label`s should have some padding (more on horizontal), default (unselected) foreground colour, reduced font size & capsule-button like look

```css

.color-scheme-segment-control label {
  padding: 3px 8px;
  color: #306FDB;
  font-size: 0.75rem;
  /* To make it look like a capsule */
  border-radius: 1000px;
}

```
<p class="imageCredits">index.css</p>

4. `label`s should have a selected foreground & background colour

```css

[name~="color-scheme-segment-input"]:checked+label {
  color: white;
  background-color: #306FDB;
}

```
<p class="imageCredits">index.css</p>

Thatâ€™s it, this is how our final code will looks like

```html

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="index.css">
</head>

<body>
  <h1>Segment Control Demo</h1>
  <div class="color-scheme-segment-control">
    <input id="light-color-scheme-segment" name="color-scheme-segment-input" type="radio" checked>
    <label for="light-color-scheme-segment">Light</label>

    <input id="dark-color-scheme-segment" name="color-scheme-segment-input" type="radio">
    <label for="dark-color-scheme-segment">Dark</label>

    <input id="auto-color-scheme-segment" name="color-scheme-segment-input" type="radio">
    <label for="auto-color-scheme-segment">Auto</label>
  </div>
</body>

</html>
```
<p class="imageCredits">index.html</p>

```css

.color-scheme-segment-control {
  display: inline-flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-content: center;
  padding: 1px;
  border: solid 1px #306FDB;
  /* To make it look like a capsule */
  border-radius: 1000px;
}

.color-scheme-segment-control input {
  display: none;
}

.color-scheme-segment-control label {
  padding: 3px 8px;
  color: #306FDB;
  font-size: 0.75rem;
  /* To make it look like a capsule */
  border-radius: 1000px;
}

[name~="color-scheme-segment-input"]:checked+label {
  color: white;
  background-color: #306FDB;
}

```

## Demo

Now, it looks pretty similar to Segmented Control on Apple Developer Website. Hooray ðŸ¥³Â ðŸ¥‚
