<p class="intro">Let us deep dive understood the for-In, forEach, for-In-Enumerated in Swift and how it is different from other languages and why?</p>

Swift provides us with multiple ways to loop through items in a collection. They are:

```swift

for language in languages {
    print(language)  
}

languages.forEach { (language) in
    print("Language", language)  
}

for (index, element) in languages.enumerated() {
    print("Index:", index, "Language:", element)  
}

```

## 1. for-In

```swift

for value in range {  
    // statements  
}

```

In many programming languages, the `for-in` loop is called **_forEach_**. Standard loop statement in other languages uses this format:

```swift

for(i = 0; i < n; i++) {    
    // statements  
}

```



## Important

The c-style for-loops are no longer supported from Swift 3

![C-style For loop error in Swift](/images/articles/iOS/swift/002-forIn-forEach-forInEnumerated/for-loop-error.webp)

In Swift, the `for-in` syntax provides a concise and versatile way to iterate over ranges, sequences, iterators, collections, and even strings. Here's an example:

```swift
let languages = ["English", "Tamil", "German"]

for i in 0..<languages.count {  
    print("Language \(i + 1):", languages[i])  
}
```

// Output:
Language 1: English  
Language 2: Tamil  
Language 3: German

```

In Swift, object types like [arrays](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/CollectionTypes.html), [dictionaries](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/CollectionTypes.html) and [sets](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/CollectionTypes.html) are known as _collections_. Any collection can be iterated with a for-in loop.

for a dictionary, we can iterate like this:

```swift

let languagesDict = [  
    "England":"English", "Germany":"German", "Mexico":"Spanish"  
]

for (country, language) in languagesDict {  
    print("The \(country)'s Language is \(language)")  
}

// Output:
The Germany's Language is German  
The Mexico's Language is Spanish  
The England's Language is English**

```

Swift also provides two range operators `lowerBound...upperBound` and `lowerBound..<upperBound` as shortcuts for expressing a range of values.

```swift

for i in 0...5 {  
    print(i)  
}

// Output:  
0  
1  
2  
3  
4  
5

for i in 0..<5 {  
    print(i)  
}

// Output:  
0  
1  
2  
3  
4

```


<p class="warning">Warning</p>

If `lowerBound` is greater than `upperBound`, the code will crash


If we want to reverse the range for looping, we can easily achieve that using:

```swift

for i in (0...5).reversed() {  
    print(i)      
}

// Output:  
5  
4  
3  
2  
1  
0

```

## Stride

As I mentioned above, C-Style for loops are not supported from swift 3, so how we can get the `increment of the counter variable` i.e. **i++**

It can be achieved using `stride`, it helps us to move from one value to another using _any incremental value_ and we can also specify whether the upper bound is inclusive or exclusive.

```swift

for i in stride(from: 0, to: 10, by: 2) {  
    print(i)  
}

// Output:  
0  
2  
4  
6  
8

```

there is also another type of stride in swift:

```swift

for i in stride(from: 0, through: 10, by: 2) {  
    print(i)  
}

// Output:  
0  
2  
4  
6  
8  
10

```

the basic difference is, `from-to` calculates the element before `to` but in `from-through` it takes the `through` element also into consideration. It's similar to `<` and `<=`

```swift

func stride<T>(from start: T, to end: T, by stride: T.Stride) -> StrideTo<T> where T: Strideable

```

<p class="imageCredits"><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/stride(from:to:by:)">Apple Docs</a></p>

```swift

func stride<T>(from start: T, through end: T, by stride: T.Stride) -> StrideThrough<T> where T: Strideable

```

<p class="imageCredits"><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/stride(from:through:by:)">Apple Docs</a></p>

## 2. forEach

```swift

languages.forEach { (language) in
    print("Language", language)  
}

// Output:  
Language English  
Language Tamil  
Language German

```

Swift provides a dedicated method `forEach` for a specific usecase, unlike the above `forIn`, this method cant break the loop part way (at some point). It has to loop over each item in the sequence.

This helps people reading your code to figure out your intent, that you want to act on all items and won’t stop in the middle.


<p class="note">Note</p>

- `break` ends the loop’s execution immediately and transfers control to the code after the loop’s closing brace (`}`). No further code from the current iteration of the loop is executed, and no further iterations of the loop are started.
- `continue` statement tells a loop to stop what it’s doing and start again at the beginning of the next iteration through the loop. It says “I am done with the current loop iteration” without leaving the loop altogether.


For example:

```swift

var evenNumbers = [Int]()

for number in (0...100) {  
    guard evenNumbers.count < 10 else {  
        break  
    }  
  
    guard number % 2 == 0 else {  
        continue  
    }

    evenNumbers.append(number)  
}

print(evenNumbers)  
  
// Output: [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18]

```

same cannot be achieved in forEach with break and continue, so we need something like this:

```swift

let evenNumbers = (0...100)
    .filter { number -> Bool in  
        return number % 2 == 0  
    }
    .prefix(10)

print(evenNumbers)  
  
// Output: [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18]

```

## 3. for-In-Enumerated

```swift

for (index, element) in languages.enumerated() {  
    print("Index:", index, "Language:", element)  
}

// Output:  
Index: 0 Language: English  
Index: 1 Language: Tamil  
Index: 2 Language: German

```

This swift loop iterates over each of the item by also telling the index of it. If we need to iterate over the elements and need their index also, then `for-in-enumerated` is the perfect loop for us.

### Nested For Loops

Also, we can use a `for` loop inside another `for` loop

```swift

var nationals = ["Brits", "Spain", "Italy"]  
var languages = ["English", "Spanish", "Italian"]

for i in 0 ..< nationals.count {  
    var string = "\(nationals[i]) speaks"
    for _ in 0 ..< languages.count {  
        string += "\(languages[i])"  
    }
    
    print(string)  
}

// Output:  
Brits speaks English English English  
Spain speaks Spanish Spanish Spanish  
Italy speaks Italian Italian Italian

```

### While

A `while` loop performs a set of statements until a condition becomes `false`.

```swift

while condition {  
    // statements  
}

var index = 0  
while index < languages.count {  
    print(languages[index])  
    index += 1  
}

// Output:  
English  
Tamil  
German

```

### Repeat

`Repeat while` loop is similar to `do while` loop in other languages.

It is similar to the above `while` loop in Swift. But, the major difference is that, this loop evaluates the **condition after running** the statements (_at the end_).

It’ll always run at least once

```swift

repeat {  
    // statements  
} while condition

var index = 0  
repeat {  
    print(languages[index])  
    index += 1  
} while index < languages.count

// Output:  
English  
Tamil  
German

```

Both `while` and `repeat` are best used in loops where the number of steps are unknown.
